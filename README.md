# Ritsu x Emerald

A small project to make Emerald Chat less bad.

You will need to have a userscript manager installed in your browser.

Popular ones are:
- [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
- [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

Once that's done, you can [Install the latest RxE script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ritsu-Projects/Public-Releases/main/ritsu-emerald.user.js).

Alternatively, use the scripts in the repository to load a specific version.
